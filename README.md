# BigBackup

Hello! 

This is a cool thing made by Keeley Erhardt, Payam Ghobadpour, and Artur Tarasenko at HackGT 2016.

It lets you put a lot of stuff on Youtube if you need space sometimes.

You need the following packages, though...

- python-qrcode
- python-qrtools
- ffmpeg
- youtube-dl
- tarfile
