Hello! 

This is a cool thing made by Keeley Erhardt, Payam Ghobadpour, and Artur Tarasenko at HackGT 2016.

It lets you put a lot of stuff on Youtube if you need space sometimes.

You need the following packages, though...

- python-qrcode
- python-qrtools
- ffmpeg
- youtube-dl
- tarfile

Youtube supports videos up to 11 hours long and 128GB in size with no max overall account cap, yet ;)

One 40-L QR code stores up to 2,953 bytes. A 40-L QR code is 177 pixels by 177 pixels, meaning in a 1920x1080 frame you can stack them 10 wide and 6 deep, for a total of 60 QR codes per frame. With 1080p 60fps footage, you can get a max "bandwith" of 38.27088 GB per hour, meaning a max-sized video would still come in under 11 hours, maximizing storage.
